# JavaScript Calculator

## Project Goals

This project was to help mez understand how to use JavaScript functions and algorithms. It also showed me how to work with the DOM and how it can respond to user input.  The template of the calculator and design were built using HTML and CSS.  The functionality of the calculator was built to react to click events on each calculator button and update the display. 

## To Dos

* Show an error message when invalid input is given. 
* Disallow invalid input.
* Allow for chaining long calculations. 
* Handle edge situations. For example, if a user starts by pressing the decimal button, they generally expect to start a decimal number, which needs a 0 before the decimal point. Add that 0.
* Allow entry via the keyboard, not just clicking on buttons.
* Add a button for calculating the modulo of two numbers.
* Add a button for raising a number by a power.
* Add parentheses to control the order of evaluation.

## Resources 

* Two ways to evaluate mathematical expressions are [eval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval) or using the [math.js](http://mathjs.org/) library.
* Using [try-catch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch)
* [Order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) must be honored.
